## What is a Clock?

The clock is the fundamental, repetitive, electronic signal that synchronizes every operation inside the CPU and throughout the entire system.

Tt is generated by an external crystal oscillator circuit (e.g., the 8284 Clock Generator chip for the 8086).

Signal: It's a continuous, periodic square wave, like a metronome for the computer.

The transistor's on/off switching is directly related to the CPU's clock cycle.

### Transistors are the Switches

A transistor is the fundamental building block of the CPU. Within the processor, transistors act as tiny electronic switches that are either fully ON (representing a binary 1, or a high voltage) or fully OFF (representing a binary 0, or a low voltage).

### Switching Speed vs. Tick Time

The CPU clock cycle (one tick) must be long enough for all the billions of transistors in a circuit path to reliably switch from their old state (ON/OFF) to their new state (OFF/ON) and allow the electrical signals to settle before the next cycle begins.

Frequency: The clock's speed is measured in Hertz (Hz) (cycles per second), such as $5 \text{ MHz}$ or $3 \text{ GHz}$.

## What is mean by Synchronous?

To be synchronous means that events or operations are timed and coordinated by a common reference signal—the Clock.

Synchronization ensures that all the CPU's internal components (like the $\text{ALU}$, registers, and control unit) and external components (like memory and I/O) perform their steps at the precise moment dictated by the rising or falling edge of a clock pulse.

## what is instruction?

An instruction (or machine instruction) is the fundamental command that a computer's Central Processing Unit ($\text{CPU}$) is designed to recognize and execute. It is the language of the processor.

It is an encoded sequence of bits (binary 0s and 1s) that tells the $\text{CPU}$ exactly what single, specific action to perform, such as adding two numbers or moving data from one place to another.

Every instruction is typically divided into two main parts:

* Opcode (Operation Code): This specifies the operation to be performed (the "verb").
    - Example: $\text{MOV}$ (move data), $\text{ADD}$ (arithmetic addition), $\text{JMP}$ (unconditional jump).
* Operand(s): This specifies the data or location to be used for the operation (the "object"). Operands can refer to:
    - Registers (e.g., $\text{AX, BX}$)
    - Memory Addresses (e.g., $[\text{BX}]$)
    - Immediate Data (a constant value, e.g., $07\text{H}$)
    Example (8086 Assembly): $\mathbf{\text{MOV AX, 0007H}}$
    - Opcode: $\text{MOV}$ (The command to move data).
    - Operands: $\text{AX}$ (Destination Register) and $0007\text{H}$ (Source Data).
These are also called as **Macro level Instructions**, these macro can be splitted into many **Micro level Instructions** these are not visible instructions

### Example of Macro and Micro
Instruction : $\text{ADD AX, BX}$

**Macro example**: 
    - The instruction itself is macro
    - Takes an entire Instruction Cycle (multiple clock cycles).

**Micro exmaple**: 
    - Tnternal steps: Load $\text{BX}$ into $\text{ALU}$ Input 1; Load $\text{AX}$ into $\text{ALU}$ Input 2; Enable $\text{ALU}$ Add function.
    - Takes roughly one clock cycle (e.g., move data between two internal buffers).

## Instruction Cycle

The Fetch-Decode-Execute (F-D-E) cycle, also known as the Instruction Cycle, is the fundamental process that the Central Processing Unit (CPU) of a computer follows to execute program instructions. This cycle repeats continuously from the moment the computer boots up until it shuts down.

1. Fetch
    The CPU retrieves the next instruction from the main memory (RAM).
    * The Program Counter (PC), a CPU register, holds the memory address of the next instruction to be fetched.
    * The CPU copies the address from the PC to the Memory Address Register (MAR).
    * The instruction at that memory address is then read and temporarily stored in the Memory Data Register (MDR), before being moved to the Current Instruction Register (CIR).
    * The PC is automatically incremented to point to the address of the subsequent instruction, preparing for the next cycle.
    * The MDR/MBR is located inside the Central Processing Unit (CPU).

2. Decode
    Once the instruction is in the CIR, the CPU must figure out what the instruction means.
    * The Control Unit (CU) of the CPU interprets the encoded instruction in the CIR.
    * It separates the instruction into two parts: the Opcode (Operation Code), which specifies the action to be performed (e.g., addition, data transfer), and the Operand(s), which specify the data or the memory address of the data to be used in the operation.
    * This stage translates the machine code instruction into a series of control signals that will direct the CPU's components during the execution phase. It also determines if any additional data needs to be fetched from memory.

3. Execute
    This is the stage where the action specified by the instruction is carried out.
    * The Control Unit sends the generated control signals to the relevant parts of the CPU, such as the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), memory, or other registers.
    * The operation is performed:
        - Data Manipulation: The ALU performs arithmetic (like addition) or logical (like comparison) operations.
        - Data Transfer: Data is moved between registers, memory, or I/O devices.
        - Control Flow: The Program Counter may be updated to a different address (e.g., for a jump or branch instruction), changing the sequence of instructions.
    * Any results from the execution are stored back into a register or memory location.

## Clock Cycle vs. Instruction

1. Clock Cycle ($1 \text{ Clock}$): The time duration of one complete oscillation of the clock signal (one pulse, like one "tick"). This is the shortest time unit the CPU can measure or use to perform a single, elementary operation (e.g., move a bit from one internal buffer to another).

2. CPU Cycle / Bus Cycle / Machine Cycle (e.g., T1-T4): This is a sequence of clock cycles (T-states) required to perform a single external transaction with the memory or I/O.In the 8086, a minimum-mode bus cycle  consists of four clock cycles: $\mathbf{T1 + T2 + T3 + T4}$

3. Instruction Cycle: This is the total time required to completely execute one machine instruction (Fetch, Decode, Execute, Write Back).
* $1 \text{ clock cycle} \ne 1 \text{ instruction}$.
* An instruction cycle is composed of one or more bus cycles (and internal CPU cycles).
